# Topics:
Building on this, youâ€™re invited to dive into one or more specialized topics:

Android: a half-day course on using Rust for Android platform development (AOSP). This includes interoperability with C, C++, and Java.

Chromium: a half-day course on using Rust within Chromium based browsers. This includes interoperability with C++ and how to include third-party crates in Chromium.

Bare-metal: a whole-day class on using Rust for bare-metal (embedded) development. Both microcontrollers and application processors are covered.

Concurrency: a whole-day class on concurrency in Rust. We cover both classical concurrency (preemptively scheduling using threads and mutexes) and async/await concurrency (cooperative multitasking using futures).
